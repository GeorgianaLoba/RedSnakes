					<h1>General Information Conference Management System (CMS)</h1>
					<h5>
						<p>
							The objective of a Conference Management System is to support the automatic management of
						information related to scientific conferences. This information concern: the authors submitting
						proposals, the members of the Program Committee, the submissions' abstract and full papers
						proposed, meta-information about these, the deadlines for different phases of sending
						proposals, assigning paper to reviewers, evaluation deadline and announcing the results of
						paper valuation. Once the accepted proposals are known, the different sections of the
						conference are decided; each accepted paper is planned to be presented in a section. Each
						conference participant has to pay the registration. The conference participants which can be:
						session chairs, speakers or listeners.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once a steering committee decides to organize a conference edition, the information about the
						event is posted on the conference site. This information includes the name of the conference,
						the interval in which the event will take place, the "Call for papers", the deadlines, the Program
						Committee, the conference sections and program a. s. o.
						</p>

						<p>
							Mainly there are 3 distinct phases regarding the management of the information preceded by a

						preliminary phase, the PC members (including the conference chair or the conference co-
						chairs) uploads information about their name, affiliation, email address, their personal web-
						page, their username for the CMS and the password for accessing the information about the

						conference. The chair or one of co-chairs have the permission to change deadlines by
						postponing them to later data.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the first phase, each person interested to submit a proposal create its own user account
						fulfilling the information required (the name, affiliation, email address). Once the account is
						validated, the submitter logins, submit the abstract and fulfills the meta-information required: the

						name of the proposal, the keywords, the topics, the possible list of authors and their meta-
						information). Depending on the conference it is possible to upload also the full paper (usually a

						file in .pdf or .ms word format). Uploading proposals can be done before the deadline
						mentioned on the conference site and on the "Call for papers". It is possible to have two
						different deadlines: one for the abstract and another for the proposal. Until each deadline, users
						may upload new versions both for the abstract and the paper.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the second phase, PC members are required to bid the proposals. Each PC member has to do a brief analyze of abstracts or papers in order say if they are pleased to review some papers,
						or if they are could evaluate some papers, or if they refuse to evaluate other papers. Once the
						bidding process closed (there is a deadline for bidding), the conference chair or co-chairs assign
						to each reviewer the papers required to be evaluated. By default any reviewer do not receive
						for evaluation a paper refused in the bidding phase. At least two different reviewers have to
						evaluate each paper. Usually there are three reviewers(evaluators) for each paper but
						depending on the conference level there can be also 4 reviewers. The result of each reviewer is
						one of the followings qualifiers: strong accept, accept, weak accept, borderline paper, weak
						reject, reject and strong reject. The papers whose evaluation do not contains any level of reject
						are accepted by default. Also, the papers not containing any accept will be rejected. In case of
						papers having contradictory evaluations the chair/co-chairs request reviewers to discuss in
						order to get closer evaluations. If this will not be possible, is up to the chair to decide if another

						new evaluation from a different reviewer will be required or if the paper will be rejected or
						accepted. The evaluation qualifier is justified by means of a set of recommendations that each
						reviewer attach to evaluated proposals. Once a reviewer uploads the results of its evaluation,
						she/he will see the other evaluations of the same paper delivered by other reviewers. After
						deciding about the acceptance or not for all submissions, the authors are announced by email
						about their results. Only papers accepted and presented on the conference will be published.
						After receiving the acceptance decision, authors are invited to improve their accepted papers
						taking into account reviewers recommendations. PC members excepting the chair/co-chairs
						can submit proposals by logging as authors. In this case, they have not the right to see neither
						which are the reviewers of their paper nor the comments between reviewers.
						</p>
						<p>
							The third phase concerns the conference activities - mainly papers' presentation. Depending on
						the number of participants and of accepted papers, the conference is structured on different
						sections, some of them organized in parallel. Each section is supervised by a session chair
						which in the most cases is a member of the Program Committee (PC member) including the
						chair/co-chairs. Authors presenting their accepted papers are named speakers. Participants to
						each section are: chair, speakers and listeners. In order to assign the most appropriate rooms
						for each section, in case of important conferences (having hundreds of participants) these are
						invited to specify which are the sections they intend to participate in. A speaker cannot be the
						chair of the section in which she/he present his paper. Usually, before the presentation,
						speakers upload on the conference site the content of the presentation by means of a .pdf or
						.ppt(x) file.

						<h2>3.2.1 Django</h2>
						<p>
							<u>Django</u>
							Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean,
							pragmatic design.
							Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as
							quickly as possible.
							Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes.
							Some of the busiest sites on the Web leverage Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly
							scale.
							Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website — from content
							management systems and wikis,
							through to social networks and news sites. It can work with any client-side framework, and
							can deliver content in
							almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, XML, etc).
							Django web application group the code that handles each of these steps into separate files:
							<ul>
								<li>
									URLs: While it is possible to process requests from every single URL via a single
									function, it is much more maintainable to write a separate view function to handle
									each resource. A URL mapper is used to redirect HTTP requests to the appropriate
									view based on the request URL. The URL mapper can also match particular patterns of
									strings or digits that appear in a URL and pass these to a view function as data.
								</li>
								<li>
									View: A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns
									HTTP responses. Views access the data needed to satisfy requests via models, and
									delegate the formatting of the response to templates.
								</li>
								<li>
									Models: Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's
									data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in
									the database.
								</li>
								<li>
									Templates: A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file
									(such as an HTML page), with placeholders used to represent actual content. A view
									can dynamically create an HTML page using an HTML template, populating it with data
									from a model. A template can be used to define the structure of any type of file; it
									doesn't have to be HTML!

									User objects are the core of the authentication system. They typically represent the
									people interacting with your site and are used to enable things like restricting
									access,
									registering user profiles, associating content with creators etc. Only one class of
									user
									exists in Django’s authentication framework, i.e., 'superusers' or admin 'staff'
									users
									are just user objects with special attributes set, not different classes of user
									objects.
									The primary attributes of the default user are:
